**About Me** 

Hi, I go by the name 'Sailer' in the writing world and Av in the physical world, with the pseudonym, Sailer Summers, because I love to sail (like Moana does) in the summer (not literally, in my imagination). I have curly hair like her and love the sea, in grey and blue colors. 

**As a Writer**

“I sail no matter how drastic the storms are: rather not to sail until the sunset is gone.”

I see myself as a sailor embarking on an adventure journey where I explore the depths of the ocean and islands despite the changing weather. This journey might be a rocky road full of experiences (referring to my writing journey) but fulfilling. I always love to experiment with new things and do something out of them. I am in love and in awe of words that let me express the worlds inside my head.

Sailer started writing way back 2012 and was influenced by the books she reads, fueled also by her imagination. She's a daydreamer who loves to write about human connections, either fluff or angst. Her stories are breathers in their own ways, with more chill and simple plots with a side of humor. She also loves to write essays about her personal experiences in life, thoughts, emotions, and ramblings that come across her mind, as well as stream-of-consciousness or can-of-worms entries. 

She aims to touch a reader's heart by exploring the emotions and realizations they feel while reading. She hopes that her works have served its purpose.

**As a Person**

Outwardly, Av is reserved, too silent, and super introverted with other people – slow to react and slow to process. Av is a dreamer and a bubbly bunny. A free-spirited soul and rational at times. The kind of woman who has the guts to do things spontaneously but is pretty emotionally driven too. She can be overly sensitive at times and can empathize with other people due to her emotional nature. Beneath a light personality lies a melancholic soul who loves to write, read, and do things artistically or randomly.
