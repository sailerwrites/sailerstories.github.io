Time flew so fast. The courage to start anew, accepting your past, including your shortcomings, mistakes, and even lingering regrets, it’s there but it doesn’t have that much power to affect your present moment unless you give it a chance to snake your mind; the will to live your life in your own terms and be braver and happier is a life-changing decision in your life. To live on our own terms, not what others have perceived of what happiness and success look like. 

Material things don’t equate to a natural choice for happiness. The tangible things are not permanent, and they can be gone for many years later, but your kindness and compassion to people around you or your loved ones may remain in their hearts. Sometimes, it takes a person or the right people that provoke your views in life and, sometimes, challenge your perspectives on some matters. It may be positive or negative. Regardless of that, it makes you a better person and makes you realize or ponder your choices in life. It may take a while for the changes to happen. We change. We transform. We liberate ourselves from our inner sufferings and close the doors or even burn a door that snatches away the fire in our souls. We unlearn things and learn new things along the way. 

Experience teaches us best. When we go through a challenge or tribulation in our life, it humbles us. It shows us how our choices and actions shape our future. When we revisit our past, each phase of our life will somehow recall our lessons from our mistakes. There’s always a consequence of an action \- good or bad. When we are full-grown adults, we can’t blame our parents or other people all the time for the consequences that we’ve suffered because we have the power to change the course of our lives. We can stay. We can leave. We can stick to our values. We can adapt while not compromising our principles and core values. 

Unlearning things may take a while. When we were young, ignorant of the truth and the reality of a certain circumstance or situation, we were thrilled by the idea of believing that it was real or the right thing to do. But as we grow older, we realize that it is not what we think it is, such as dating matters, marriage, love, values, practices, beliefs, and traditions. We unlearn what our child or teen self believed in years ago, but the beauty of accepting to unlearn things also means accepting how innocent we were before, how it is very different when we experience it in the present, and how we are growing each passing day or year. 

The moment we breathe when we are babies, we have the chance to live fully here on Earth. We discover, explore, learn, unlearn, grow, develop, and transform along the way \- experiencing things on our own accord. Our mindset and perceptions change as we grow up, taking in the influence that we gather and filter through our circles and surroundings. 

Looking back, I was a timid, shy, and silent teenager who tried not to get into conflicts and follow the rules. Not most of the time. I have my rebellious moments, and I stay true to what I believe. I have no backbone and can’t stand up for myself fully and express what I want because I avoid conflicts and fear they don’t understand me. However, I realized that as we grew up, transitioning to adulthood also meant standing up for oneself and staying grounded at the same time. We can’t rely on others when managing our lives or our life’s direction. We carve the paths, take detours at some point, and go to our destination. It takes setbacks and challenges to become more resilient and braver when facing another set of hurdles again. This strengthens our resolve, transforms our mindset, and adapts to the changes in the environment or the world. 

We, humans, have the power to change the course of our lives to gain our happiness. The philosophy of Stoicism allows us to develop our self-control and our emotions and accept and focus on what we can control. The philosophy of Ikigai and Existentialism enable us to discover what inspires our soul every day. 

We may adapt to what we think is good or what is right. We may allow ourselves to change as we go through our experiences in life. We may have changes and transformations while remaining humbled and sticking with our principles and core values. We may unlearn things and learn new things as we grow older. We may ponder on our mortality and live life to the fullest. 

We are humans, capable of living on our own terms.
