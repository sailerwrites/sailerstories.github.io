# Simala: Reflecting on our faith

The trip to Simala started when I learned the story of St. Benedict from my work friends and shared the spooking story of our home – and that we needed that protection. It all started from that desire to relinquish the ‘bad vibes’ inside our home. My team lead at work told me about it, and then I decided to visit Simala Shrine in Lindogon, Sibonga, with my mother. It was July. I thought about visiting the Shrine and Mary’s Palace in the South of Cebu. It’s been years since I haven’t been there – and it’s way back in high school. A distant past. We only visited Simala with no souvenirs. Now that we have come back, I have surely secured souvenirs.

I was still sleepy when I woke up at 5 am in the morning. Technically, my mother woke me up, and I was still half-asleep when I took a bath. I wore a long dress paired with sneakers because they were comfy and appropriate for a church visit. And, of course, I chose a backpack instead of a tote bag to store my essentials, including my gadgets (such as my phone and headset (for sound). We had breakfast after we had ready our things. We didn’t bring food since it was only the two of us (my mother said that we could afford it, by the way). But at that time, we didn’t know what the actual budget for our getaway would be, not to mention the budget for souvenirs. Regardless of that, as a money-conscious potato l, my mother told me that it’s only money. The important thing is we enjoy our visit and that we buy what we want. So that’s what happened.

We got in the v-hire with other passengers, and in a town with a very small road (Carcar), we witnessed an accident. It was quite bothersome at first because I witnessed it in front of my eyes. It was the second time my eyes caught a car accident, and it was awful to witness that. Moving on, I tried to get it out of my head and focused on the surroundings outside the v-hire. The scene didn’t bother me anymore because I was so fixated with the greenery, the rice fields, cows, goats eating grasses, and the sea.

I had a signal problem with my phone and had this paranoid moment that we were in Argao and we passed by Sibonga but I realized that I was so stupid for not knowing that it was a signage. We’re still in Sibonga and when I saw the signage – Simala. I was relieved. My mother didn’t worry because she knew and I on the other hand, had a mini-paranoid moment.

The weather? The heat was scorching, and there were only minimal clouds to cover it. That’s why most of the people who visit the Simala Shrine bring their own umbrellas, and I was glad I did bring one in case. The first items we bought in Simala were white shirts printed with Mama Mary’s face and then my mother bought ‘lana’ before we went inside the Shrine. It was very hot outside, and there were so many people visiting. I didn’t wonder why because Mama Mary’s birthday would be two weeks from now, September 8\. We were only early, and the volume of people overwhelmed us. It was a good thing my social anxiety wasn’t on the run at that time because I focused on buying the St. Benedict medallion for protection as well as other religious items that would help me and my family.

As a Catholic, the statues, relics, and other religious items were symbols, a representation but not the real thing and the significant part is our faith. We held onto these things to strengthen our belief and faith to overcome our struggles and, achieve prosperity and receive blessings from the most high. I have my own reasons for remaining Catholic, and that’s because of Sto. Niño, the child Jesus, Mama Mary, and the rest of the saints that I believed in. I read their life stories, and before, it inspired me to become like them – to be holy and faithful someday, but I know I fell short at times, and I keep coming back.

It was eight thirty-something in the morning when we went inside the Simala, and behold, the place looked like a palace. It was a magnificent view; the faraway mountains and the Sibonga Sea add to the magnificent Simala shrine. It is a Catholic pilgrimage site for Mama Mary. Simala is a wide-range structure that is full of terraces and columns. There were so many people who admired the place. When we got inside, we realized that Mama Mary’s birthday was approaching. The pilgrimage site was not entirely finished, but it was nice enough to be there for the whole day. We waited for the souvenir shops to be open so that we could buy religious items. And we did, despite the volume of visitors and tourists there – a mix-up of local and foreign tourists. We decided to go inside so that we could receive a ‘bendisyon’ from the priest, especially the religious items that we bought there. The shoes should be removed because of the tiled floor, which has a great and classic design. We prayed and stayed there for minutes. I took pictures of Mama Mary’s statues.

After that, we decided to go outside because we were hungry. My mother wanted to have ‘sabaw’ while I salivated on lechon outside of the Simala shrine. We ate lechon, two servings of rice each, and soft drinks. We bought religious items and souvenirs – again. In tagalog, it’s a budol spree.

We went inside again and attended the Holy mass and worshipped the Lord and his mother and the queen, Mama Mary. I was emotional at that time, and I held my emotions because, of course, I was used to bottling it up. It was really a different experience when you were with fellow people who have the same faith in God, worshipping, praying, and asking for a plea. We were there for various reasons. And I’ve read the testimonies of people who believed in God and Mama Mary. They surrendered their wheelchairs, scratches, and other hospital items when they were sick, thanking the Mother of God. There were also board passers who thankfully shared their testimonies. I even recognized the design of a paper that I used before in high school. I’m always fascinated with people’s stories and experiences in life.

The items that we bought for the second budol spree, the priest blessed us with holy water. My mother even bought candles for her bestfriend. They have the same birth month and she bought a matching rosary. While I bought Simala keychains and rosary for myself – the color of opal, my birthstone and I remembered that October is rosary month. We wore the St. Benedict necklace until we went home.

We went home when it was three in the afternoon. We got on the V-hire with other local tourists who also went home from Sibonga to the city of Cebu City. I put on my headset and realized that the signal of my data was fine. I turned on my Spotify and chose upbeat songs. I got sleepy, and my mother was beside me, near the window, closing her eyes and napping. I was wide awake, but I kept yawning. The roads were wet in the towns that we passed by.

We were hungry again and ate in a fast food restaurant with nice grilled pork and cucumber lemon. I bought a mix-and-match order of Jollibee – fries and yum burger for my younger sister, who asked for it – her cravings.

When we were finally home, my mother gave the items to her best friend – the candles, the rosary, and the oil. I changed my clothes and went to bed. Tired and satisfied from our Sibonga journey.

It’s not the religious items that we bought but our faith. I believe that the Lord and his mother, Mama Mary, protect us from bad things, day and night. We hold onto that faith that we heal on our time.
