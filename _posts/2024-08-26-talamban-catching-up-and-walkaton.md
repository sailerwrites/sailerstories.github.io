# Talamban: Catching up and Walkaton

*Talamban: Catching up and Walkaton with Nature and the City, Mundane Talks*  
*friends that rarely communicate every day*

My love language is quality time, yet I’m always the kind of a friend who communicates or keeps in touch with my friends when I am in the mood, when I have enough free time, or when I feel they need my presence. I will be there for them if they want to have someone to listen to them. I have a guy bestfriend, we’ve been friends for eight years and onwards. there were years we only saw or bonded with each other, four times or even three times because we were busy in our lives or we were busy being busy.

But we are introverts, it’s a norm to keep in touch every other day and when we meet, it’s like before. It’s like we haven’t been away with each other for months and years.

It’s been months since we haven’t seen and talked with each other. Due to my relapse, I contacted him and he was a bit furious of knowing that my illness came back, but not stronger. And then, he has his own sentiments or problems, that’s why just like before, we confided with each other.

We were spontaneous than ever. We have no itinerary for the day but somehow I knew that we have the same interests – music and walking. Well, korean food too and I was surprised that I ate much at Barangay Seoul.

I ate almost everything, except the chicken of course. I had enough side dishes and even a tasty seaweed soup that I like. My taste buds is more sensitive and I want to eat and eat due to the side effects of my medications. After we ate, we sang to our heart’s content in karaoke. Even though the quality of our voice is different, my voice blended with his powerful voice. That’s what he said.

**The Talamban wandering and walkathon**

It’s a nice weather – cloudy.

Talamban has a straight route yet it’s very far from the city proper, almost same as Busay or Consolacion. Even though I didn’t agree with going with my best friend, I chose to go with him because it’s expected. We always spend time with each other for almost the whole day. We visited his brother-in-law in the cemetery and he introduced me as his bestfriend for life. We won’t be away in this lifetime, perhaps, because we sworn in front of his brother-in-law that we were and are best friends for life and we will stick with each other in this lifetime even though we said it in a playful manner and I was just messing around.

As usual, we are those kinds of friends who like to walk, walk, and walk while catching up with each other. Since it’s been months we haven’t talk with each other, we were conversing while we’re on sidestreets. Me, laughing and messing around, just like the old times. We bonded just like the old times.

After we visited the cemetery, he decided that we would visit his niece and nephews, his family in Talamban. We were casually walking again, no thought of riding a motorcycle to his family’s home. We could survive with just walking for a long period of time. I talked about my long-distance friends, particularly one of them who’s currently ‘MIA’ and my relapse as well as about my work. Him, he talked about his latest whereabouts, his dreams, and his studies. We were each other’s human diary or a free therapist.

Talamban is a mix of modernity and greenery. There are corners and spaces which filled with trees, plants, and wildflowers. It’s like a taste of countryside wherein you’d see mountains, valleys and hills from faraway. The colors were mix of earth brown, yellowish, brownish and greenish leaves and the falling leaves on sidestreets. There were only few vehicles, mostly motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. We have to be careful walking on sidelines since there were fast-moving motorcyles or four-wheeled vehicles.

My best friend’s fam saw us walking beside the streets, recognized his walking form. We rode on the motorcyle until we arrived at his family’s home, meeting his niece and nephews. After that, we exited the house and walked again with no exact destination. It’s getting dark back then and there were only few lampposts in the area. The green canopy from afar was darker and even more quiet than during the day. The neighborhood seemed like an idyllic village in the province. There were only a few houses there as well as sari-sari stores. The roadside was not that friendly, there were no fences beside, so with one move, we would fall below the cliff but I had fun walking with my bestfriend as we talked about many things. The weather was cloudy and perfect for long walks. We decided to go back to his family’s house when it began to drizzle. We ate our dinner there and only bought canned tuna that he mixed with soy sauce. I was the one who initiated in washing the dishes that we used as well as the rest on the lavatory. Before that, I took a couple of shots of our wandering, bad photos actually.

After that, we dared to walk on the darkness of the place – seeing the eerie well that had a funny anecdote from my bestfriend as well as the dark trees around us with only little light from electric posts and the moon. It was quiet there. I’m on medications and relapse, I was more sensitive with the car noises and I told him that. My anxiety was acting up when he saw me. That’s because when I’m on relapse, I want to just stay at our house, away from crowds and noisy places but I chose to see and bond with my bestfriend because we needed that. We haven’t had talk with each other for months – no news of our whereabouts.

After we left the road to the hearth of the valley, we found ourselves on the main street. Instead of taking a jeepney, we just walked for miles, straight and just like the old times. Talamban to Ayala Proper is far yet we managed to reach our destination – going home because it’s already close to midnight when we reached my family’ store. We had a lot of things we talked about, happenings and moments from the months we haven’t had news with each other.

This might be just a lulinghayaw entry or wandering entry but I enjoyed my time with my guy bestfriend.

We are both weathered by our experiences in life. Lost and broken sometimes. Healing and taking chances. And we’re still here: supporting each other. This may not be our last walkathon. I enjoyed the Colon-Talamban-Budlaan-Talamban-Lahug walkathon and wandering.
