Umuulan. 

Nakatitig si Chea sa kawalan nang lumabas siya sa building kung saan siya nagtatrabaho bilang office staff. She was wearing a mermaid skirt, violet blouse and cardigan. Puti ang sapatos niya ngunit hindi na niya alintana ang basang kalsada habang bitbit ang payong. She glanced at her wristwatch. The skies were supposed to be a riot of colors \- bursting in red, orange, pink, and violet but the skies were bleak now, desolate and the colors everywhere were dull except for the trees on the sidewalks. 

Mabagal lang ang paglakad niya. May direksiyon ang mga paa na tinutungo ang lugar kung saan sila magkikita ulit ni Kyle. Hanggang sa huli. 

It's time to say goodbye. 

They met when they were in highschool and parted ways in college with no enough closure. There were remnants of feelings but it was only fleeting. She hoped this would go well. 

. 

.

.

Nagmamadali si Kyle. He almost forgot about his appointment with Chea \- the woman he loved from highschool until college. Natagalan pa kasi siya sa pag-troubleshoot sa PC ng isang employee. He was an IT staff from a big company. Malapit lang din ang building ng workplace niya sa Café kung saan sila magkikita ni Chea. 

They need this closure. 

It was once upon a time when he remembered her pretty face while the wind was playing with her soft hair while she was running to the exit of their school gate. 

Hinabol niya ito dahil naiwan nito ang school shoes nito sa P.E. room nila. 

"Chea\! Intay\! May naiwan ka\!" Agad naman nitong narinig ang pagtawag niya sa pangalan nito. Bumagal ang pagtakbo nito at lumingon sa kanya, nanlalaki ang mga mata. Nakatigil lang ito nang tumakbo siya papalapit rito, habol ang hininga. 

"Kyle?" Bitbit niya ang sapatos nito at dumako naman ang mga mata nito sa sapatos nito. "Oh."

Habol niya ang hininga nang makapagsalita siya. "Naiwan mo." 

Saka lang nito napansin ang suot nitong rubber shoes. "Oh, thank you. Sorry, nag-abala ka pang isauli ito. Thank you talaga, Kyle."

Nakangiti ito nang marahan niyang ibigay ang sapatos nito. May nakasuksok na dahon sa buhok nito kung kaya't di niya natiis na abutin iyon. Dahil sa ikinilos niya ay namilog ang mga mata ni Chea. 

The gesture pinched her heart. It was not a physical contact but somehow his actions and the way he looked at her told her something that there could be more. But she cut off those thoughts in her head. 

"May dahon sa ulo mo."

"Oh, thank you." 

It was the moment he realized, he liked her. A lot. 

It was also the moment she was aware of him. 

It was only a memory now. Tinakbo na lamang ni Kyle ang Cafe, walang pakialam kung nababasa na siya ng ulan. It was only a scattered rain. Hindi naman tipong mababasa siya na parang sisiw. 

.

. 

.

Kaunti lang ang customers ng Café at pinili ni Chea ang table na nasa sulok lang. Matatabunan sila ng bonsai roon at walang makakarinig sa pag-uusapan nila ni Kyle. 

Napatingin siya sa singsing sa palasinsingan niya at napangiti. It was the ring he gave to her nonchalantly. And then the next day, he had a girlfriend. The funny thing was the ring was only a random gift for their Christmas party. 

It was a sunny day and the clouds looked like cotton candies from afar. Galing sa library si Chea at akap-akap niya ang mga librong hiniram niya. 

Ang mga paa niya ay ang direksiyon patungo sa Gazebo ng university. Papalapit na siya nang mamukhaan niya ang lalaking tawa-tawa, katabi ang isang magandang babae na may biloy sa mukha at maikli ang buhok. 

Napahigpit ang hawak niya siya libro. Bakit parang may alimpuyo sa sikmura niya? Why did she feel this way? When they weren't even together. And he laughed at herself in her head. Di ba si Kyle ang reason kung bakit nandoon siya sa university? And now, he was laughing with some other girl. 

Naestatwa lang siya doon hanggang sa mapansin siya ni Kyle. Nakangiti pa rin ito pero unti-unting humina ang tawa nang makita siya. Agad siyang tumalikod at huli na nang mamalayan niya na may nakaalpas na luha sa mga mata niya. 

It was supposed to be the day she accepted that she liked him. A lot. 

But he was happy with another girl. 

Napailing-iling na lang si Chea nang maalala ang tagpong iyon. It was all in the past. Ililibing na sana niya pero naapektuhan pa rin siya hanggang ngayon. Ano ba ang ginawa sa kanya ni Kyle? Bakit ba ganoon ito makatingin sa kanya? Like she's the prettiest in the world. And she downright fell for it. 

She was watching the raindrops fall on the glass wall when someone approached her. She was mindlessly staring outside when someone cleared his throat. Doon na siya napatingin sa harap niya. 

Kyle smiled at her. Halatang naulanan ito. 

"May I?" Tumango lang siya at hinayaan itong hilahin ang upuan upang makaupo. 

She was kind'a nervous and the night before she recited the words that she wanted to say but now that he was in front of her, she couldn't find the right words. 

"Hi," he spoke. 

Tipid lang ang ngiti niya. "Hello."

"Um-order ka na?" 

"Nope. Hindi pa." 

"Creame latte gusto mo?" he asked. Dati kasi kapag nasa kapehan sila, madalas niyang order ay creame latte pero ngayon nagbago na. Gusto lang niyang magising kahit ngayong gabi lang. 

"Ice americano. Seventy percent sugar."

Saglit itong natigilan sa order niya. "Oh, okay. Ice americano it is. Order lang ako for us."

Tumango lang siya at hinayaan na itong um-order sa may counter. He always has a lean back even before. He was a soccer player and she was almost hit by the ball from the soccer team when they were in college. Doon lang din nito nakita siya mismo sa university. Bago lang din ito sa soccer team. Unlike sa usual na haircut noong college. 

May kahabaan na ang buhok ni Kyle na umabot sa batok. He looked manly with that haircut. She smiled to herself, realizing that she was checking him out. She sighed. Napailing-iling na lamang siya. The important thing is that she needs to be transparent and honest with Kyle. They didn't do that before. They didn't spill their emotions and thoughts to each other. 

When he went to their table carrying their orders, she looked up at him. As usual, Kyle had a smile on his face while putting down their iced americano on the table. 

"Kumusta ka na? Hindi na tayo nagkita after natin grumaduate ng college."

Last time nga na pagkikita nila ay noong college. Nagkataong magkasabay sila ng college niya at ng college nito. 

"Kasama mo ata yung gf mo n'on that time," she said. Kinuha niya ang cup niya at inikot ang straw roon. 

Saglit na nagtaka ito sa itinanong niya. "Gf?" 

"The lady with the short hair." 

Doon lang tumining rito ang sinabi niya. 

"Oh, we broke up six months after our relationship. She only asked for my help to win her ex-boyfriend back. Kaunting sulsol lang, bibigay na 'yung ex niya. They're engaged now." 

Napakurap-kurap siya sa narinig. He just chuckled while taking his seat. Sinalubong nito ang mga mata niya at ngumiti. 

"You really did think that I liked her enough?" Tumango siya sa sinabi nito. He sighed with a forced smile on his face. Sinalubong ulit nito ang nalilito niyang mga mata. "No. I'm afraid I'm too coward to tell you the truth back then." 

Umiyak talaga siya noon at nasaktang makita ito kasama ang babaeng iyon. Why did she had to use him? 

"May kasalanan din naman ako. Puwede naman akong tumanggi at sabihing may gusto akong iba at hindi ko siya matulungan. But she's a good friend. Marunong din naman ako tumanaw ng utang na loob." 

It was her turn to sigh. She drank her coffee through the straw and cleared her throat. 

"I saw you with her. At hindi na kita nilapitan dahil naiyak na ako." 

Nanlaki naman ang mga mata nito.

"What? You cried?" 

Naitirik niya ang mga mata niya. "Later ko na din na-realize na . . . na gusto kita." 

"Hindi na ba ngayon?" 

She was taken aback with his questions. His eyes were intense, asking those words. 

"Gago ka ba?" 

Hindi na nito napigilan ang sariling tumawa sa outburst niya. 

"Anong akala mo? Tulad pa rin ang nararamdaman ko sa iyo, noon? Hoy mister, aba ang suwerte mo naman kung hanggang ngayon, I'm still carrying a torch for you. It's not." There was a bit of frustration in her tone. 

"Fine, fine. I'm sorry. But noon lang?"

"Kasalanan mo din naman. Hindi ka umamin. Ramdam kita kahit hindi ka magsalita. Para ka kayang ewan noong highschool, nagst-stutter ka pa kapag ako na kausap mo. And here." Tinanggal niya ang singsing na ibinigay nito sa kanya noong party sa college nila. "You gave this to me and I hid it somewhere. Sinuot ko lang ngayon. Medyo masikip na." 

It was his turn to be dumbfounded. Nahiya yata ito sa actions nito noong highschool sila at nang makita ang singsing na inalis niya sa daliri ay napakurap-kurap lamang ito. Saglit na lumambong ang mga mata nito at marahang dinampot ang singsing. 

"I gave this to you as a silent promise. That someday, if I'm stable, I will find you and court you. May boyfriend ka man o wala."

Namula naman siya sa mga salita nito. Malungkot ang ngiti nito. Gusto talaga niyang suntukin ito. Umabot pa nang ilang taon bago nito inamin ang tunay nitong damdamin. Naitirik niya ang mga mata niya sa halo-halong emosyon na nararamdaman ngayon. Nasasayangan siya sa mga pagkakataon sanang puwede silang dalawa pero inaagaw iyon ng tadhana sa kanila. At ngayon, isa rin bang pagkakataon na magsimulang muli? O pagkakataong putulin na talaga ang koneksiyon nila? 

Umawang ang bibig nito nang makitang lumuluha na lamang siya. "Hey, bakit ka umiiyak?" 

"Iyakin talaga ako. Buwisit ka talaga. Bakit ngayon pa." She cleared her throat and contained herself. He gave her a tissue and she dried her tears with it. 

"I'm sorry. I did really hurt you back then." 

Bumalik na naman niya ang inis rito. Mabuti na lang dahil ayaw na niyang lumuha pa dahil sa nasayang na nakaraan nila. 

"Gago ka talaga." Suminga siya at uminom na lamang ng malamig na kape para kalmahin ang sarili niya. Maging ito man. 

"I'm sorry for telling this to you. Hindi naman ako ganoon kamanhid dati pero ayoko ring mag-assume. I always liked you even before college, highschool pa lang pero masyado akong insecure dati. You were surrounded by suitors coming from well-off families."

"Hindi ko naman sila gusto. That time, all I could think of was I really wanted to accept anything from you and if not, I'd return this ring but I did not do that. I treated it as a memento." 

Ito naman ang hindi makapagsalita agad sa sinabi niya. He avoided her steely gaze. Pinagdiskitahan ng mga mata nito ang kape. 

"Damn. Bakit ba pagdating sa iyo nababahag ang buntot ko?" nasabi nito sa sarili. 

"It's water under the bridge now, Kyle. My feelings and my thoughts with you. Do you want me to be as honest as I can be to you?" 

Then, he met her eyes. Napabuntong-hininga na lamang siya. 

"Yes."

"Hindi ko masasabing same intensity yung nararamdaman ko sa iyo noon at ngayon. I cannot say that I like you now but trust me that I liked you years ago. But that Chea changed, Kyle. Now, ayoko nang maghintay na ikaw ang kakatok sa akin. If you will try now, to reach out to me, I won't say no but I won't say yes either. You got me?" 

He slowly nodded, tapping his fingers on the table. Pinanood niya ang pag-alis nito ng cover sa cup nito at pag-inom nito ng malamig na kape. 

"But what if I try to reach out to you now?" 

"Now, we are talking." She crossed her arms. Sumandig siya sa upuan niya at tinatantiya ito. 

"Do you really want to reach out to me? What if I have someone close to my heart today? What if someone courts me and I'm planning to give him a chance?" she asked. Naningkit din ang mga mata niya. "I won't allow you to reach me if you have someone dear to you, apart from friends or loved ones. Kung gusto mo akong i-pursue ngayon, make sure that you are honest with me, and communicate with me every now and then. I'm afraid that na-trauma ako sa iyo noon, you were giving me mixed signals and instead of telling your feelings before, you kept quiet about it. Don't blame me for it." 

He leaned on the table. Inubos na rin nito ang kape nito. His eyes were telling her something and she won't budge. Well, almost. 

"What if I try today? What if I don't have someone dear to me, just like how you've been dear to me in the past? What if I'm interested in pursuing you for real now. Will you allow me to? I will be as honest as I can be. Gusto mo talaga na maging honest ako sa iyo? I regretted my highschool for not confessing my feelings to you \- that I really like you. I regretted that I went along with her, dismissing the growing feelings that I have had with you. And now? It's still there. Will you allow me to risk this love for you?" 

Siya naman ang nagulat sa pahayag nito. He was emotionally honest now. Bigla na lang siyang tumayo. Hindi niya masalubong ang mga mata nito. 

"Gutom na ako. Nag-crave ako ng mainit na bulalo. Baka may bulalohan rito." 

Sukat sa sinabi niya ay bahagyang natawa ito. His expression softened. It was still there, the way he looked at her way back in highschool.

"You still like bulalo?" 

Sumingkit ang mga mata niya. "How did you know?" 

"You always muttered to yourself that you were craving for a bulalo when the school ended. Didiretso ka niyan sa bulalohan sa labas ng eskuwelahan kahit pa mainit ang panahon."

"You stalker," akusa niya rito. 

He chuckled and it melted her heart and her defenses. Why did she has to pretend that everything was not the same anymore? 

"If di ka sasama sa akin now dahil busy ka, then this is the time we will end to this. If you will follow me, then I'll give you a chance." 

She left her unfinished coffee and picked up her shoulder bag. Nagulat ito sa bilis ng mga kilos niya. Iniwan niya ito roon na namimilog ang mga mata. Not giving him a chance to answer her question. 

"Wait. Chea." 

Agad naman itong nakahabol sa kanya hanggang sa labas ng Café. Basa ang paligid ngunit hindi na umuulan. Makulimlim pa rin ang kalangitan. It was a perfect weather for her bulalo hunting. 

"I will go with you."

But she was quite guarded now. Gusto lang niyang makasigurado. If magwo-work out ba ngayon. Sa kasalukuyan. 

She offered her hand to him. 

"Fine. Then go with me." 

Agad naman nitong tinanggap ang kamay niya. He had a warm hand that enveloped her cold, soft hand and she blushed. Sinamantala nito ang pagkakataon na nakakulong ang kanyang kamay sa kamay nito. Humigpit ang hawak nito roon at hinila siya papalapit rito. They were so close with each other and he whispered into her ear. 

"What if I won't let you go this time? Will you allow me?" 

He was asking for her consent and she was completely speechless. Ang ginawa na lamang niya ay niyakap ito. She was closing her eyes and felt her heartbeat.

If this is happiness and love, why would she let go?
