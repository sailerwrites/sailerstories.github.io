**Key Takeaways in Compostela**

My travel experience to Compostela allowed me to bask in the little things of nature – away from the rowdy crowds or beaches filled with people. One of my colleagues (now a former colleague because she resigned, the host and the granddaughter of the house where we stayed in Boljoon) told me about the outing and one of the reasons was our senior was resigning back then, so they planned the outing for us. Still, I’m a freeloader this second time around. All I did was to say “yes”. I have enough to plan for packing, yet I was always a newbie when it came to packing so I brought more things than usual.

Here are some unusual takeaways I learned from the Compostela trip:

**I have to pack wisely.**

It’s amazing to know that some of my co-workers only bring one bag and with only a few belongings, some have small bags for their clothes and essentials. And I have a black Donut backpack – huge enough for a two-day and one-night stay in Paraizzo Garden Cafe. I have a friend who packed his belongings wisely and I want to learn from him – he only has a small bag for all of his belongings – including an umbrella. I looked like a backpacker who traveled around the world with my huge backpack.

**Packing spontaneously in one night and packing the week before is entirely different.**

I was lucky back on the Boljoon trip because the clothes were easier to find than when I packed for the Compostela trip. I searched for the rashguard in our house only to find that it was hanged in our room. I bought junk food, biscuits, a tetra pack of sterilized milk, and essentials which I put inside the wash bag. I packed too much for that outing.

**I won’t last long for an all-nighter.**

Days before, I was lacking sleep even though I had a hunch that late-night talks would occur again. My body wanted to sleep at 10 in the evening but we lasted to almost 5 in the morning. I barely slept, so I had a couple of “lutang” moments there. I escaped the Boljoon all-nighter but not in Compostela – in Paraizzo Garden Cafe. I am just a regular human being who needs eight hours of sleep, so opting for a call center job is not really for me. I barely lasted for a night of “no sleep”.

**I couldn’t last talking about dark and disturbing topics.**

I may be boring to others because I prefer to watch, read, or absorb films, dramas, and topics that are calming, positive, and relatable. As a sensitive person who is overstimulated when there’s too much happening around me and an INFP, I’m easily disturbed or affected by dark, disturbing topics so I don’t consume them all the time. I don’t like hearing negative news, murder, or crime or reading horror and depressing or alienating books. Yet I consume them little by little. I am now reading one book about isolation and loneliness, and I have to stop because it hits close to home. Although I’m not directly involved with the topics and their disturbing information, the unknown future filled with the impending dystopian world, solar storms, and other dark stuff may overwhelm me. As a nervous and overthinking bunny, I may visualize it strongly and feel it strongly if I’m in that situation.

**I need downtime desperately.**

I thought that if I traveled, I would forget the creeping loneliness and unmotivation I felt after March. So I went with my colleagues. They have nothing to do with what I feel inside but I need downtime or recharge to collect myself – my energy that deteriorates each passing day. So before saying “yes” again, I have to make sure my energy is enough for that day or outing.

**I don’t care about first impressions or even hierarchy.**

I am not a conformist. I don’t follow trends in the society. I am not updated and I don’t have a Tiktok app on my phone (Thank god, I don’t have that abyss-like app). So when they talked about a certain trend or popular figure, I couldn’t follow.

To sum it up, they have different first impressions but I kind of expected their first impressions because of my silent, reserved, and aloof nature and I was misunderstood that I am a snob, an unsmiling colleague who even ignores our Senior Supervisor. But I was just too shy.

I realized that I’m at ease when I have similarities with another person – their interests, their passion for books or writing, or any interests. I always love to discover many things, an explorer of different interests.

They finally realize my introversion and my weird sleeping habit (This is not a takeaway but a realization).

All of my shortcomings and my actions were just a manifestation of my introversion. I am an introvert through and through even though I am quite a dreamer and have a light or goofy personality when I’m comfortable and when I’m with my close friends. I am so introverted that it takes time to be comfortable around with some people. Oversharing my mental health journey on the bus when we went home from Boljoon, sharing my weird sleeping habit, and my dark humor or unconventional jokes, they witnessed that. Somehow, I could finally say that I found a small tribe with my colleagues – the ones who knew how stressed I was at work, the fast transition we experienced, and our funny interactions even though I was in Ayala and most of them were working in the Talisay branch. They knew my trauma-dumping moments, my rants, my dark humor, and my lack of interest in the opposite sex or love life. It will be bittersweet to part ways with them because it’s inevitable to leave and search for greener pastures – to future employers who will take care of us fairly and with good compensation.

**The time in Paraizzo Garden Cafe is slower.**

It’s slower than we were at work. 9-5 may not fit an INFP like me but the job I have now is a security for the future unknown. I’m imagining the worst. Going back, when you don’t do anything and you are in a faraway place that bustling a little life – no buildings, establishments, or pretty conveniences like restaurants, convenience stores, or a bookstore. Sometimes, I spaced out, looking at the greenery, the effect of El Niño on the forest, the faraway sea or nearby island, and the occasional clouds. Time is always slower in the countryside when you have little things to do. You don’t think about being stuck in traffic, crossing streets, dealing with crowds, dealing with irate clients, doing hard tasks, and accepting new responsibilities and duties. We are far from the trifles and worries of our jobs, responsibilities at home, and adulting. It was a pause for us.

**I have always admired the countryside even more and I want to retire early.**

Despite the scorching heat of the sun, I still admire the palm trees and the mountains filled with forest trees, bushes, and wild plants. The ride to the Garden Cafe was quite long for me and my colleague just admired the little scenery that Compostela offer. When we get to Paraizzo Garden Cafe, it’s like a little garden and a small village of Kubo-inspired shelters. There were stray animals and pets, as well as rabbits, on the lower part. There’s a Wi-Fi connection, but I haven’t used it. I didn’t check my phone and just hung out on cabanas, spacing out occasionally. I didn’t think about the job or my responsibilities that I left in the city. Due to solar storm scare or the sightings of aurora, losing the Internet would cripple the entire world – the economy and I would be jobless. We don’t know of the future, it’s uncertain.

**The way home is better.**

Yes, undeniably. I like the ride way home. It’s peaceful. And I had my share of seeing the scenery outside the jeepney. I’m still floating due to lacking sleep but the way home was better than going there in Compostela. Sometimes, I was not comfortable with the restroom at times the kubo itself because of the lock, and despite the nice nature around us, my symptoms mostly manifested there. From lacking sleep, stress, and triggers from the month of April.

A recharge is a solution. Even though I am surrounded by fellow introverts, I also need to have downtime for myself, which may take months. I have to embrace my introversion and set my limits. My brain can follow but my frail body needs rest from time to time. Exerting myself would only sap my remaining energy.
