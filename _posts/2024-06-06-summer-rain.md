It’s been years since he didn’t come back to his hometown. A camera dangling on his neck and a trolley he pulled to get on the bus, Myungsoo stared at the rain falling outside the bus window. A summer rain.

As he closed his eyes, he remembered he offered his umbrella to her. They’re beside each other. Silently feeling the drops of rain on their feet. Regrets washed over him, If only he stayed.

That one summer rain, he wouldn’t forget the tears fell from her sad eyes. The moment he’d left her to go in the city, to pursue his dreams. She used to be the girl who loved fairy lights underneath the blankets they shared. The girl who bravely faced the ocean waves with him.

It was summer rain he realized that everything was fine when he was with her. She used to be the girl who taught him about petrichor and how it calmed her.

She used to be the girl who loved him to the point that his heart was bursting in bliss.

As the tides touched his shoes, he remembered how she wrote their names on the sand as if they were going to be with each other forever. But their names were erased by the ebb tide just like how forever had been erased in their love story.

The summer rain was gone now. As he got down from the bus, Myungsoo knew that everything changed. That he would indulge the scent of the afterrain alone. And that he would be the only one on the beach. Basking himself under the scorching heat of the sun.

He knew that the night he left, she wasn’t his anymore. He was drenched in their memories ,and sometimes his mind wandered from the town he loved, where his heart was taken by a girl with summer eyes. And now, she’s happy. Finally happy.

Even with someone else.

That summer rain, he watched her slowly disappear. Disappeared from his life. Just like how the summer raindrops stopped.

Now, he watched her as someone else’s wife.

And he thought at that moment, he couldn’t achieve his dreams and his girl at the same time.

Myungsoo left the town again. Leaving everything behind. And hoping that the tides washed it away.

Hopefully whispers to the summer rain of a brand new start.
