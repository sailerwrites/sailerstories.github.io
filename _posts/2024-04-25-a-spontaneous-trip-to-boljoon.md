**A Spontaneous Trip to Boljoon**

Timeline:  
March 15 – 17  
Year 2024

**Spontaneous decision that I did**

I was busy doing my tasks when I got bored and had extra minutes to spare. I had this urge to gossip, so I approached one of my workmates to confirm the information that had reached my ears. But because of one of our colleagues in a different department, I knew that the other team of our group (still in our department) would have an outing. So my interest perked up, knowing that two of them would leave the company and I wouldn’t have the chance to be with them again, so I asked that workmate if they would allow me to go along with them. And then, they agreed. We are not really from the same circle of friends, but we have gone through a toxic workplace, and we have the same sentiments. We survived, and now, we were on several transitions in our team. And now, some of us were saying goodbye to each other, leaving us in our batch. But that’s life. People come and go, and no one knows what will be ahead of us.

Going back, I spontaneously decided to go on an outing trip with them somewhere in the South. It was a last-minute decision on my part but I am positive that I could make it through as long as I’m with my trusted friends in our workplace. After work, I went home to pack everything in my backpack and tote bag. I also packed the essentials I needed for the entire trip. Three of my workmates remained in our building to fetch me so that we could go together to the South Bus Terminal.

Towing my backpack and tote bag along with my jumpsuit and beige sneakers, we rode on a jeepney. When we reached the terminal, they reserved tickets for us, and our supervisor carried our food – including rice, canned goods, coffee, and so much more. We boarded around nine in the evening.

**On the bus**

I sat beside one of our AAs, and we had a blast talking about the toxicity of our workplace, eldest daughter’s responsibilities, past life experiences, and so much more that we were the only ones who didn’t take a nap inside the bus. She’s near the window but still, the scenery outside the bus was not visible to our eyes, except the lights and signs on the road. It was an air-conditioned bus, so it was not humid or stuffy inside, but it was cold, so I hugged the jacket to myself. Eight of us went on a bus journey; some were sleeping on their seats, and we were talking nonstop. It was good to catch up because the next week, we would be in different locations or offices since our company had built a new building for the company after so many years of establishment.

We bet on the time we would reach our destination – Boljoon, a town somewhere on Cebu Island. My seatmate/workmate and I bet on 2 am since I’d seen the traffic in one town but later on, we reached midnight. Like other towns/municipalities in the South, the towns are idyllic, serene, and filled with greenery.

**Welcome to Boljoon**

One of our workmate’s grandmothers waited for us in her house, thinking that maybe we passed by their house. She was accommodating and you could sense that she’d weathered her experiences in life and chose to live in that sleepy town – close to nature and the beach. I haven’t seen the beach at that time, only in the morning. So we got there at bedtime and we placed the banigs, pillows, and bedsheets. The second story is wide and enough for eight sleepers. We were warned by one of our workmates that she had a weird sleeping habit, and so did I, which they later discovered the next morning. Since we were tired from the whole journey, we only talked for about one hour and more and closed our eyes to dreamland. I woke up one time, and the sky was still dark; it was probably still dawn. I already knew my workmate’s sleeping habits, and I guess I am not the only one who had a weird sleeping habit. Well, every one of us had our quirky and weird habits.

I went back to sleep and when I woke up again, the sun had risen and it was time to prepare our breakfast. Of course, they cooked and we prepared our essentials and swimming clothes because we would swim in the sea. That morning, I saw the wide expanse of the sea from the second-story window. It’s close to their home, and it would be nice to live in that sleepy town where there’s no noise pollution and life is slow compared to my city life.

My friends prepared the food – both meat (pork and fish). We have to grill it at the resort. We changed into our swimming clothes, and no one dared to wear one-piece or two-piece – just rash guards and plain clothes, which we usually wear at home. We would be hitting two birds in one stone.

We went to the resort and found out that we were the only people there so it was like the resort was exclusive for our group.

**Vitamin Sea (the first day)**

The entrance fee was cheap, and it didn’t exceed thousands. It was worth it knowing that we had the resort for ourselves. It was a sunny day, so the sea showed its glory and gorgeousness. The clear salt waters were teasing my eyes for a moment, urging me to seduce its cold seawater. The ocean waves have their own duty to calm our nerves. We were out there, laughing and joking about random things while some of us prepared the grilling station and the food we would eat later on. One by one, we set on the ocean first before we proceed to the pool and its chlorine water. I didn’t know how to swim, but I enjoyed the cold saltwater while we conversed about life. The water is crystal clear enough to see our feet underneath. The sea stones and corals aren’t a nuisance to our feet so we just swam like there’s no tomorrow. Some of us remained because they were grilling the meat. I realized that the ocean varies depending on the location and the community folks. They have been taken care of by the townsfolk there, a representation that the town is sleepy and has lots of natural resources. We could see the blue skies that reflect the turquoise waters. The bluer the skies can get, the bluer the ocean can be. The waters weren’t that deep, and it was my first time swimming in cold seawater because it’s usually mild when it comes to coldness. Maybe because it’s a sleepy town and there are not many people who contribute to the pollution.

After we swam in the sea, we went back to our cottage because it was time for our lunch – which meant we had to eat grilled meat with rice and cool soft drinks. We also have a white wine courtesy of one of our friends who would resign from the company. By the way, I agreed to go on an outing trip with them in Boljoon because two of our workmates would say goodbye to the company and I want to experience having an outing with the rest of my batchmates. We entered the company at intervals of days and months, so I considered them my batchmates. All that’s left are a few seniors like me and the newbies or newly hired for months now.

Going back, we enjoyed our food and thanks to our vibrant and lively co-workers. We dipped our cutlets into spicy and non-spicy sauces (consisting of soy sauce, onions, chili, and calamansi, the classic sauce of the Filipinos). Apart from that, we shared the white wine that only had 6% alcohol content. We took some pictures for mementos and just ate to our heart’s content. The meat is equally delicious and I like the flavors of the fish – salty.

**Swimming pool and pool talks**

After we ate our delicious and fun lunch, we proceeded to the swimming pool. Exclusive for us since we were the only group of people there, including Jes’s cousin (our host). From now and onwards, I will provide them with their shortcut names here.

Thank goodness, the pool didn’t reek of chlorine and it was advantageous to me. The pressure of the water in the pool is different from the ocean. The ocean has more pressure and our movements are restricted but I could compare their differences that’s essential for my next book soon.

Going back, I always love the feel of the water, whether saltwater or freshwater. It’s refreshing and can calm my nerves without the effort and now I can say that it has positive effects on me. I could say that stress went away just like that.

The fun part of us swimming in the pool is our walking race because the majority don’t know how to swim so we just waddled in the water. I’m always the second or third one, but it doesn’t matter as long as we are happy at that time.

Bonding with them in the province means time is slowing down. I was kinda surprised that time is slower here than in the city where everything is hectic and fast-paced.

We talked about life matters, but we wandered into mature topics, especially the taboo for Filipinos since our elderly are quite conservative, so these talks weren’t common. But it was my fault since I started the sex-related topic and since half of our group had experience with it. Well, it’s quite different from fiction stories written by adolescents and minors.

Apart from that, we pretended that we rode on a banana boat through a photo technique where one of us took a snapshot of our silliness while holding the banana. One of us couldn’t swim because her hair was still in treatment so it’s vulnerable to salt and chlorine, water chemicals that can affect its nutrients or sort of.  We stayed in the pool for three hours and we talked about hiking on the hill after our swimming bonding.

We packed up after we showered. We put on our dry clothes and went back to the house. We realized that we were tired so we postponed our supposed hiking. We were just so lethargic from swimming from morning to afternoon, and all we did was to gain back our energy from sleeping. So I slept too. Well everyone of us. After we woke up, it was late in the afternoon. We had no time to hike.

**Evening talks**

After our dinner, we prepared for bedtime, but as expected, we had a long way to go before we went to the dreamland. Our evening talks were a continuation of our pool talks – the mature topics. I learned something that was included in fictional books but way different from reality. It was an educational yet fun experience for me. Well, half of us knew about it in a new light, while the other four were just sharing notes. There’s no such thing as objective standards of femininity, or it’s a symbol of our purity.

But before that, we had a game – Uno. Miss Anne taught me how to do the game, and luckily, I was the second one to finish my cards, and then I lay down. The rest were just funny and revealing talks about that certain topic. I got sleepy at 11 in the evening, and they continued talking as I went into the dreamland.

**The second morning**

I woke up early in the morning because I needed to pee. But the rest of my workmates/friends were still sleeping. I decided to sleep again but when I woke up, they were still sleeping. So I just stared at the ocean. The sea was bluer that day than the waters yesterday. The sea was bluish and greener yesterday.

It was sparkling under the sunny morning. It was refreshing to wake up in the province with just the sounds of nature around you.

**Vitamin Sea (the second day)**

My friends were still in dreamland so I decided to visit the sea for a while and took pictures. So I did. It was low tide and the sea was calm. It was nice to hear the sea waves approaching my wet feet. I could feel the sand and stones underneath my soles. Visiting the sea for a while provided me with calmness in a short span of minutes. I didn’t stay for too long because it was getting hotter and I didn’t bring an umbrella with me.

After visiting the sea and taking some shots, I went back to my workmate’s grandmother’s house because it was getting hotter. My friends/workmates decided to go on a spring; it was not a literal spring but somewhat a pool of spring water. I volunteered to stay behind the house because no one was there. Nanay went out to the church in Lungsod, so I have another reason to stay. I just don’t want another set of wet clothes again from swimming or taking a bath somewhere.

**Staying behind to rest**

I stayed behind for the sake of just being alone. All I did was listen to music while lying down on the wooden and floor-waxed floor. I’m like a starfish while facing the huge ceiling fan but still the weather is hot. But not as hot as we experienced in the city, maybe because there were trees around us.

After that, I decided to take a bath in the bathroom. Of course, it’s not spring water or seawater. Fresh from the bath, I went back to the room and typed on my cellphone for the first chapter of my first installment. It was a productive relaxation. My co-writers went back and refreshed, but they shared the dipper. And I’m glad I stayed behind despite the fact that I haven’t experienced taking a bath with spring water.

We ate our lunch before we packed up our things and essentials because we would go back to our home.

**Museum tours**

We said goodbye to Jes’s grandmother and joked about going back if we ever ran away from home, but that’s impossible. We were comfortable with each other despite the fact that we were all introverts with different personalities.

We went to the Boljoon museum, and before that, we had a short tour of the Boljoon church. I realized that even before the colonizers took over our archipelago, villages and barangay communities existed in our country. They have a rich culture and traditions. That’s Boljoon.

We toured around the museum and explored the town’s heritage and culture. It revolves around religious artifacts, excavation discoveries, precolonial burial traditions, and trading from centuries ago. Indeed, the Philippines is rich in religious artifacts. Most of the precolonial artifacts weren’t preserved because colonizers destroyed them. Few remained but six feet under. You have to excavate them with advanced tools.

I realized that I would discuss this in my next travelogue.

**End of our trip**

We ended our trip with a refreshment. We waited for the bus and it only took minutes when we rode on the airconditioned bus. I sat with Miss An’s and we talked for the entire ride. It was a satisfying trip that I won’t forget.

It’s my first time going that far with my workmates. It was a good travel experience that I won’t forget.
