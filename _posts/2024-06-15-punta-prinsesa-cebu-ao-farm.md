title: Punta Prinsesa, Cebu: AO Farm
subtitle: At first, we decided to go to Tops Cebu, where you can see the entire Cebu City from an observation deck that is shaped like a circle. We can see the panorama view of Cebu City, and its majestic view during the day and night. I had already imagined that, but my best friend changed his mind because what I had in mind was that we walked to Tops Cebu via Talamban – the route that we walked when we were there. He said that the route was steeper and more dangerous for us to traverse. So he abandoned that idea, and so did I. He suggested the AO Farm and I agreed when I checked its photos and vibes on the Internet by reading an article by a blogger.

**Punta Prinsesa: AO Farm, Long Walks, & Nature on Tops Until Sunset**  
**The plan**

At first, we decided to go to Tops Cebu, where you can see the entire Cebu City from an observation deck that is shaped like a circle. We can see the panorama view of Cebu City, and its majestic view during the day and night. I had already imagined that, but my best friend changed his mind because what I had in mind was that we walked to Tops Cebu via Talamban – the route that we walked when we were there. He said that the route was steeper and more dangerous for us to traverse. So he abandoned that idea, and so did I. He suggested the AO Farm and I agreed when I checked its photos and vibes on the Internet by reading an article by a blogger.

**The packing (not again)**

Like last time, I overdid the packing again and my younger sister told me that a backpack was not needed knowing that we would walk or hike. It would be an inconvenience, so I dropped it. I only use my tote bag where I put our snacks, essentials, and a tumbler filled with water. I’m glad that I didn’t bring many things. I am always a girl’s scout to a fault, bringing things that weren’t much of use, just like what I did on the Compostela trip. A complete overkill.

**Meeting again**

We saw my best friend in front of a mall when we got out of the jeepney. He was wearing a shirt with a rainbow print as if telling the world that he’s part of the “federation,” and he is. He recently discovered it years ago, and all I did was just observe him and let him reveal himself and his orientation, but I didn’t mind because he’s still a male to me, my guy best friend. He had a blast since her mother bought her a set of clothes due to his behavior. He could be immature to a fault and a protective best friend at times. My younger sister and I bought the items because I am attending a wedding on June 29\.

**The ride to AO Farm**

The ride to AO farm is composed of commuting – jeepney to Punta Prinsesa and tricycle to a certain barangay where the driver dropped us off. Then, after that, we walked to AO farm. We walked to the heart of the mountains, so the road wasn’t friendly, but nature covered us from the heat of the sun and somehow made us calm and just walked and walked. There was no clear signal there, so I opted not to check my phone. I have always loved to observe my surroundings, the forest, its trees, and the view of the forest on the rolling hills and faraway mountains. So I didn’t mind not checking my phone. I always treasure the moment when I’m in the middle of nature, just an outdoor walk with my sister and my guy best friend. We discovered the almost empty Buhisan dam, no existing water or even a river of water – the aftermath of the El Niño. Without clear signals and data, we took pictures of nature.

**AO Farm**

It was like we were on the top of the world. It is far away from the noisy and crowded downtown area of Cebu City. You don’t have to travel in the countryside to get a taste of provincial life. I bet the time there or the life is slower than the hearth of the city or the downtown. But I would really love to have a house near the mountains and yet have the privilege to go to the city through transportation and not that far faraway. I just need to secure a transportation vehicle where I can travel anywhere. I will have the best of both worlds. If given the chance in the future.

When we got there, we had a blast of climbing up the steep road and then looked at the scenery below – admiring it despite the cloudy weather. I am a terrible ‘photographer’ and took terrible shots as well. Although the farm had a caretaker, the farm was not well-maintained. There was supposed to be a zipline there but it was dysfunctional we tried the rope course, shouting in fear of thinking that the rope would collapse from our weight. And the big swing that caused us dizziness. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the view from the swing. There was a tree house there, and we stayed there and ate sweets. It’s cloudy, and that’s why we only get a small taste of the sunset. We took pictures of the farm with lion statues, dwarf houses, and even the flowery arch. There were only limited flowers and the dogs in the farm followed wherever we go especially my best friend since the dogs recognized him from his last visit.

**The way home**

After a couple of shots on hammock and staring at the view below, we decided to go home. So we walked again. We managed to entertain ourselves with music the way back despite the darkness since it’s evening when we got home. Before we got home, we ate in Barangay Seoul and I was so stuffed that I complained about walking. My legs were about to give up and good thing, we came home with a full stomach so that we could sleep.
