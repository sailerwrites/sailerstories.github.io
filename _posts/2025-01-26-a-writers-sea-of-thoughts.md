A Writer’s Sea of Thoughts is a personal space for thoughts, musings, and reflections of a writer – discovering the spectrum and facets of our interconnected lives.

I let the currents take me to the depths of the sea and chip out what’s inside of me, the turmoils as an artist, a writer, a reader, and well, a critic since I am a litterateur. I scribble almost everything but I usually gravitate to themes about human relationships, self-development, and life’s complexities. Reading and writing has been my passions every since and it ignited tired and weary soul. It's like I was traversing a road with no lights but when I hold unto the fact that there are fireflies that will guide me, I won't mind sharing my words to the world. 

Being a writer also comes with a responsibility. That your words may have the power to inspire a soul and touch their hearts. As writers and lovers of language, words are our way of expressing oneself. Even though this space (A Writer's Sea of Thoughts) will be my junkyard where I’m going to share with you my soiled thoughts, narratives, and topics that interest me as a writer, a reader and a litterateur, I have this goal of sharing my take on different matters - literature, theories, art, writing, reading and so on that involves my passion for words. 

My perspective in some matters may be different from what you have know or you believe in. It's fine. I won't impose my views and it's my subjective opinion on such matters. A Writer's Sea of Thoughts corner is a space where I can share what's going in my head whenever I finish reading a book, a realization from a movie that I've watch, the interpretation that I've earned from listening to music and analyzing its lyrics, and many more that revolve around things that interest me. 

Be my guest in my unending thoughts and the universe inside my head.
