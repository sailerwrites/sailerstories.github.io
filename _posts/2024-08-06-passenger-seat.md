Kung may ibang tao ang makakarinig sa pinag-iisip ko, malamang sasabihin nila na napaka-petty ko dahil passenger seat lang naman ‘yan. No biggie. But sometimes, it’s really hurts because, in a way, I was put in a place that made me realize I’m just the second one.

“Sorry, Noelle. Nasanay na talaga ako na maupo sa passenger seat, katabi ni Gab. But if it’s not okay with you, I can make adjustments,” malumanay na sambit ni Sofya sa ‘kin and all I could muster was to said it’s okay while shaking my hands.

All throughout our ride, si Sofya ang kuwento ng kuwento kay Gab. And they would laugh together while I’m trying to listen to the music on my mp3. Nakasandal lang ang ulo ko sa nakasaradong bintana ng van. But their laughs and chattering are loud enough to make me feel envious of their friendship, of their relationship as bestfriends. 

It was like someone’s pounding in my head, telling me that in this film, being a bestfriend is better than being a girlfriend.  I’m  Gab’s girlfriend, and I’m supposed to be beside him in the driver’s seat, keeping him awake while we drive to the beach to celebrate our graduation.

Katabi ko sa backseat ang natutulog na si Aimee, common friend namin ni Gab na siyang dahilan kung bakit nagtagpo ang landas namin ni Gab noong second year college. That time, I was in hysterics because the deadline of the term paper was two hours away and the print shops was full of people. Tinawagan ko si Aimee para humingi ng tulog ngunit hindi niya sinagot. Instead, she texted me only to find out na si Gab pala iyon at nasa kanya ang phone ni Aimee. Naiwan ng gaga ang phone niya sa pagmamadali, makarating lang sa SC Office kung saan isa siyang councilor.

 

Gab is a smooth talker, ang casual lang ng approach niya na para bang matagal na kaming nagkakilala. He could charm his way out if he’s gotten into trouble, like how he casually reasoned out to a prof about him passing late projects. There’s no denying that he’s freakingly handsome, and that boyish smiles are to die for.

We exchanged numbers and chatted at midnight frequently. After six months, we became a thing. Paano ko nga ba na-realize na mahal ko na pala siya? Simple, when I felt like seeing him for the first time and couldn’t get enough of him. His playful messages. His boyish smiles and laughter show his white teeth. His back hugs and his sidehead kisses.

Meeting Sofya was unexpected, and I never thought that Gab had a girl best friend. That’s why he had to cancel our date after our final exams, because he has to cheer her up for failing a subject. Aimee told me. Noong una, okay pa sa ‘kin. I’m the girlfriend and she’s a best friend but she knows him better. And I don’t want to be needy and clingy to him, that’s why I let him with Sofya. Wala naman talagang kaso sa akin not until months ago, I discovered something, and it’s still killing me.

“Why are you here, Noelle?”  Aimee sat beside me, while I am just staring at the ocean waves, meters away from the sands. “You’re supposed to be with Gab now. Ayon, inagaw na naman ni Sofya.”

“They’re bestfriends,” sabi ko na lamang at napatingin sa flip flops kong may mga buhangin na.

Aimee rolled her eyes. “You’re the girlfriend. There’s a boundary between being a girlfriend to someone and being a best friend. And I hate seeing you like this.”

“What do I look like?” I faked a chuckle and pursed my lips. “Lagi naman kaming magkasama ni Gab kaya okay lang sa akin na magkasama sila ngayon.”

 

Ayoko talagang tinititigan ako ng ganito ni Aimee dahil mababasa niya sa tono ng boses ko na hindi ako sigurado sa sinasabi ko. Days ago, nakita kong similar lang sila ng stories sa instagram, meaning that they’re together and Gab forgot that it’s my mother’s death anniversary. Ipokrita ako kung sasabihin kong hindi ako apektado.

“You can’t lie way out of this, Noelle. Sabihin na nating matagal na silang magkakilala pero ikaw itong niligawan ni Gab. Pati ako, nalilito na rin kay Gab. Nakalimutan yatang girlfriend ka niya. Not all the time e kailangan nandiyan talaga siya kay Sofya para alalayan siya. Ikaw ba, naging dependent kay Gab? To answer that question, yes at first that you were together. Dahil nga may Sofya, bigla ka na lang naitabi,” naniningkit ang mga matang litanya ni Aimee.

“Sofya is your friend before you even meet me, Aimee.” Hinayaan kong tangayin ng hanging-dagat ang nakalugay kong buhok. Tamang-tama lang ang weather to stay out, cloudy with just a glimpse of sunrays.

“We drifted apart when we have a couple of differences. And those differences were my similarities to you. Who watched serial crime documentaries and gore horrors late at night? Tayo lang. Also, nagiging annoying na siya sa akin. She acts like she's the priority. Naiirita ako kalaunan but that's my opinion.” Nagusot ang ilong ni Aimee at tumayo na, pinagpag niya ang maong shorts niya. “Aren’t you going to stand?”

“Maliligo ka? I’m not in the mood to swim.”

“Matagal ka nang wala sa mood. Sa biyahe pa lang natin.” I avoided her stare and just sighed. Tumayo na lang ako at pinagpag na ang damit kong nakapitan ng buhangin.

Bakit ba masyadong observant ‘tong si Aimee? Even though I am not saying anything, she could sense something is going on, or not right.

“Tayo na nga lang mag-date. Girl’s time. Buwisit na Gab.”

 

“Hey, it’s okay. Mas galit ka pa yata sa ‘kin,” I joked.

“Because he treats you like shit, okay? And he’s a total shit. Most of the times.”

Nagmukmok lang ako sa hotel room namin ni Aimee, instead of having a good time with our friends. Text ni Aimee, nagvi-videoke daw sila. Ako nga ang topic sa GC dahil nga wala ako doon at KJ ako. Pinapasundo nila ako kay Gab.

I saw him with Sofya, in a pasalubong shop and my heart ached again. Noong una, iniignora ko na lamang ang sakit, knowing that there are reasons I could count. Tinatapal ko ng mga rason para ma-justified ko na ang petty ng mga kurot ko sa puso.

 Lintek na passenger seat na ‘yan, sumisirko tuloy ‘yung utak ko sa nadiskubre ko. It was only an accident but because of that, I am so uncomfortable and my head was pounding for months now. Kung napansin man ni Gab iyon sa akin, ay hindi niya sinasabi sa akin. That guy, he is really terrible when it comes to confrontation and I’m fine with it. To know our thoughts and emotions at the moment. Our anger. My anger actually.

Naalala ko tuloy kung paano ko siya pinaamin na may gusto siya sa akin.

Hindi ko sila sinipot sa cottage. Baka ma-feel ko na naman na nanliliit ako sa sarili ko doon. They’re common friends with Sofya and I barely know them. I have nothing against Gab’s friends, but sometimes it’s too draining to be with them.

Nang gumabi na at magutom ako ay kumain ako sa isang resto grill. I’m good with seafood, which Gab has tons of allergy same as Sofya. Napasimangot na naman ako habang ngumunguya ako ng grilled pusit pero hindi iyon naging dahilan para mawalan ako ng gana. The meal is sumptous, realizing that having my company is better than with them if it means my peace of mind.

I was staring at the sea, mirroring the night skies when someone approached me. Exaggerated man pakinggan pero naramdaman kong si Gab ‘tong papalapit sa ‘kin. My heartbeats. And his footsteps.

“Noelle?”  I turned to him, while hugging myself. I instantly smiled, telling him that I’m fine. Barely. “Why are you here? Is there a problem?”

“You’re the second to Aimee who asks me that. Sorry hindi na ako sumali sa inyo kanina.” And I couldn’t tell him why. “I ate my dinner. Ikaw?”

“Busog na ako sa dami ng kinain namin kanina. Hindi lang naman ikaw ang wala doon. Aimee too. She’s nowhere. Akala ko nga, magkasama kayo.

Vocal si Aimee na ayaw niya maki-ride on sa mga kaibigan nina Gab at Sofya. At napilitan lang din siya sumama sa graduation getaway dahil nandito ako.

“Hindi,”  I answered and just stared at him, how the moonlight touched his face and how the sea wind played his curls.

“Give me your hand.” My forehead knotted for a second yet I extended my hand. May kinuha siya mula sa bulsa ng shorts niya, revealing a native bracelet. Isinuot niya iyon sa wrist ko at nakangiting bumaling sa akin.

Oh no, Gab. Why do you have to be like this? Hindi mo alam na natatapalan mo ng mga ganitong gestures ang mga doubts at insecurities ko.

“It’s nice.” Napatitig ako sa bracelet at nakitang may pangalan ko iyon. Noelle. “Thank you.”

 

Yumakap na ako sa kanya, thinking that this would be the last. He has still the same perfume mixed with the scent of the sea. “Five minutes?”  Referring to the length of our hug.

“You don’t have to ask, Noelle.” Ang liit-liit ko sa mga bisig niya at komportable man ako sa yakap niya, ang isip ko naman naglalakbay sa ibang bagay.

“I love you, Gab,” I uttered, pinigilan ko ang sarili kong mapiyok. Why it is too painful now to utter those three words now?

“I love you too.”  I settle for those words for now if it means, it’s for someone and he still didn’t realize it now.

And I have to close this page now.

Although I love him but I  couldn't stand that there was someone that can sway my love for him or his love to me.  I'm selfish, but I want him to look at me like  the way he looks at his best friend. Damn it.

 It fucking hurts.

Sofya and I are not close, and Aimee is right. We are the exact opposite poles of the magnet. She’s girly, always smiling and fond of wearing dresses, while I’m fond of jeans and sneakers, slightly boyish and has a resting bitch face. Constrasting talaga kami sa isa’t isa, and maybe that’s one of the reason why I am Gab’s girlfriend. Until now.

I messaged Sofya at sinabing magkita kami sa isang coffee shop, just somewhere Ayala. It’s my comfy place but I’d rather want to be there, to calm my nerves even if I’m going to end this thing. Tama nang umiyak na ako kagabi dahil rito at sana’y di obvious na nangungulumata ako. If I will prolong this, di ako matatahimik at maglo-loop na lang ako lagi sa mga bagay na nakakawala ng logic. Sabagay, kailan ba naging logical ang pag-ibig?

Nauna akong dumating sa coffee shop. At nag-order ng iced coffee. Makalipas nang ilang minuto ay dumating na siya at um-order ng strawberry frappe. And my mind wandered on how Gab accidentally ordered a strawberry frappe for me. Maybe, he was thinking of Sofya that time or just he’s used on ordering the frappe for her, that he forgot that he’s with me. Nakakapanlumo lang.

“Why does he have to realize it longer?”  I asked out of nowhere and  there’s a look of confusion on her angelic face. Hindi ko alam kung nagmaang-maangan lang siya o hindi. “You know what I’m saying, Sofya. His romantic feelings for you.”

“That is impossible,” she said in disbelief and sipped on her frappe. Nang tingnan ko ang kamay niya ay bahagya iyong nanginginig. “You’re the girlfriend.”

But you’re more than just a bestfriend to him. Sometimes, I feel like he’s just using me without realizing it yet because he’s too afraid to face that he’s developing feelings for his bestfriend. Or maybe, his feelings were just dormant for years.

“Sometimes, he treats me like I’m like you. So he tends to order food that you like. Or that he forgot that I don’t go for rom-coms like you are, and I just let him. Tanga ko, di ba?”  And then, she was speechless. Sino bang gustong malaman na hinahanap ng tao ‘yung mga qualities ng bestfriend niya sa ‘yo?

“But he’s really into you. Forgive him for being a mess. Nasanay lang talaga siya sa akin.” Is she trembling, trying to defend her  bestfriend? Gab?

 

I shook my head, hindi pa rin ginagalaw ang iced coffee ko. “I’m sorry to say this, but he’s too stupid to realize that the person who really means to him the most was beside him all along. And no, Sofya. Your letter is not a lie. Even if you tell me it is.”

Nalaglag ang letter na nakaipit sa libro ni Sofya na ipinahiram niya sa akin dahil nga wala pa akong libro nun sa Business Math. Nakalimutan ata niyang nakaipit iyon doon. Her letter where she bared her feelings to her bestfriend and it crepts me at some nights, thinking that what if I am not in the picture? And I am just a girl who will connect the bridge they have with each other? And they’re just so blind to see it in different light?

But shit. Bakit pa may kailangan pang masaktan para magtagpo ang lintek na bridge na iyon?

“I’m sorry.”  And then, she cried. Naiyuko niya ang kanyang ulo. And I almost sighed because I was expecting this, that she was sorry for this, her slip-up but still, I know this is inevitable.

“No, don’t be sorry. Hindi mo naman mapipigilan feelings mo para sa kanya.”

I don't want to cry. Please, lord. Spare me.

“Why do you have to do this? You love him.”

“I am not that nice, Sofya. But I’m tired. Too tired to understand all this,”  I muttered.

Wala ako sa mood mag job hunt at kahit si Aimee ay hindi ako magawang kuyugin kung saan-saan. I’m too broken to move. Nakakalat lang sa baba ang mga tissue na nasaid ko na kagabi sa kakaiyak.

“Ouch,” daing ko nang makabangon na sa kama, dahil nga naging estatwa na ako ay naging manhid na rin ‘tong mga muscles ko. I lived a sedentary life for three days, not checking my phone and my social media.

Nang i-on ko ulit ang phone ko, rumagasa ang text messages doon. Nangunguna ang pangalan niya.

*You:*

 

*Gab, coffee?*

 

*11 am sharp.*

 

*At my fave coffee shop.*

 

That will no longer be my fave coffee shop.

 

**And next time, I will make sure I’m not in the backseat, but the damn passenger seat.**
