When you travel, there’s no denying that you have learning experiences along the way. We travel for various reasons and my reasons for this trip were merely because I want to spend this time with my friends in the workplace, cherishing the final moments we have as a co-worker. After all, we never know when our last day in our company will be.

My travel to Boljoon was a spontaneous decision that I made on the same day of our trip but it was still a rewarding experience. Here are some of my takeaways that you can reflect on, travelers.

**Being spontaneous sometimes can be a rewarding experience.**

If you’re a planner, you have the tendency to plan before the day of the event, meticulous about every little thing that needs to be considered but when you’re a go-with-the-flow person, being spontaneous is not an unusual occurrence but a part of your personality. And that applies to me. I’ve always been the scattered one. I am an OC person, I’ll always follow my gut feeling and just go with the flow. I am not me if I am not scattered so being spontaneous is not a new experience to me.

This trip was a last-minute decision and it took place when we were hours away from the actual travel experience. Packing my clothes and essentials was just random. I chose them based on what my hands got but not everything may not work out since I forgot to bring an extra shirt, realizing that I barely have shirts since I like to wear long sleeves or sweaters in the office. The moment you know the reason behind the spontaneous then it’s fine. It might be nerve-wracking for people who plan everything but trust me, it will work out in the end.

**Sometimes, you don’t need an elaborate plan to work things out.**

When planning an outing trip, My friends and I plan everything but in the end, it’s just a mere sketch in our mind. We talked about what would be our itinerary yet we were too busy to make it real. Sometimes, our plans didn’t make it for various reasons, such as weather disturbances, work commitments, and other appointments in our lives. So, sometimes, I trust that travel trips that aren’t elaborately planned work out better than the ones we plan but it depends on the situation. In some instances, it would work out but it doesn’t mean we could follow our itinerary knowing that there could be circumstances along the way.

Our trip to Boljoon was just a conversation with our workmates and I was not included in this plan because they’re on another team so I didn’t really have an idea about it. I only found out about it on the same day as our trip. But they have already bought our food, essentials, and other things that we need. Each one of us carries our bags filled with our clothes and essentials. Elaborate plans aren’t necessary as long you don’t forget the basic needs or necessities we need during the trip.  I’d like to discover the history, culture, and traditions (particularly precolonial times) of every town I visit or will visit soon.

I am a Literature graduate so it’s a default that I like discovering and exploring the history of the places I visit. I couldn’t care less about it before, but I am particularly interested in the heritage of a certain local town on our island – especially during precolonial times.

Undeniably, almost every town in the Philippines was influenced by colonizers because we were under the colonizers for many years than the years we were independent.

We toured the Boljoon church and the Boljoon museum. We discovered that villages and communities existed even before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines. They landed first on our island – Cebu.

From outside, you could sense the historic landmark’s vibes, that the church was made during the Spanish colonial era. Some of its features were renovated but since it’s a UNESCO Heritage site and one of the oldest churches in the Philippines. It has one of the longest aisles aside from the Calungsod Church in SRP in Cebu City.

There were pulpits of the four saints yet those were the replicas. One of the panel were still hidden from the public and no one knows when it would come back to the public. The other three were known to be seen in public and only one remained in the church and only one also retained its paints and features. The altars of the church were made of real gold and brass. The paint on the ceiling was a depiction of religion, protected from the birds that passed by the old church, and was inspired by the works of Michaelangelo. There was even an organ and it was the first time I saw a huge organ used by the local choir of Boljoon.

We went inside the museum which had three galleries, each consist religious artifacts, old archives, old and detailed statues, and other tools that existed in precolonial and colonial times. The oldest structures were from the colonial era and the oldest artifacts date back to the precolonial era. Our ancestors had their own culture, traditions, customs, and lifestyles. They believed in the afterlife so they had different ways of buying their families. In Boljoon, they buried them underneath their house so when they were excavated, bones were found including artifacts, accessories, and jewelry. The ancestors even offered food for them, believing that their family members who died would go hungry in the afterlife. Their settlements were made of materials around them during that time and after the Spaniards colonized the country, they influenced our ancestors, even our way of life before.

There is so much more to explore when it comes to the history and heritage of Cebu towns and I want to discover more about them, in every way possible. For my future travels, I want to know the history of the place.

**I realized that I wanted to retire in the countryside or a sleepy town.**

City life could take a toll on your mental health. Everything is fast-paced and it’s almost suffocating to stick to your routine and you barely have a work-life balance. Adulting makes me appreciate the little vacant time I have for myself but do I have that? Seeing the wooden house reminded me of my grandmother’s peaceful life in the province of Mindanao. I want to have a wooden house with plants and vegetables around it, a small garden, just situated near the sea and not far away from rice fields or forests. I want to live in a house where I have the best of both worlds.

I’m sick of my city life. I want to have a slow life in the future, with minimal exposure to advanced technology, away from negative news and toxic environment. It was an ideal future for me. I don’t have ambitious desires, except this. Who wouldn’t want peace of mind in their retirement years?

**Don’t hinder yourself from new experiences.**

You want to save so you keep on saving up but when you reach your forties, your friends and loved ones are far away with different priorities so they don’t have time to go with you if you want to travel. Regrets are always in the end. I didn’t want to hinder myself from new experiences, so I went on this trip with my friends instead of worrying about my expenses. I know that I have extra and I badly want to alleviate work stress that accumulates in my mind. So if you have spare, travel and gather new experiences to your heart’s content. Remember to be mindful of your decisions.

Traveling makes you realize many things as you travel to different places. Every travel is a different and rewarding experience. You have lessons and gain knowledge of the place – including its history, heritage, culture, and even the locals that live there.
