What are your choice of books? Do you prefer short stories, long novels, or poetry? What are your usual readings? 

Each of us, bookworms, and wide readers has our preferences when it comes to books. There are lots of books out there, waiting to be read and explored and it depends on the readers if they picked it or ignored it. Our choice of books may start from the moment we open a book way back in childhood and I remembered that I am fond of flipping my English Language book to search for stories like legends, fables, myths, and random short stories of ordinary people. My first choice of genre is a short story, anything that can be consumed in a short time or one sitting. I've always been introduced to novels that tell stories about life in general. 

# Start of my Reading Choice 

I couldn't afford books I picked some old books with yellowish and brownish pages and these books were books about life and community. My first children's book is Bridge of Terabithia, that's the first encounter I had with the universe was this book considered a children's book when there's death in the end? I pondered on that and then I read Tuesdays with Morrie and encountered death. Reading these books while in high school made me aware of my own mortality. I also read a book about a community in Ireland that shifted my cultural perspective on marriage and divorce. Books made me aware of how vast the world is and that every country has its own culture, traditions, beliefs, government system, and people's traits that are very different from our country. 

Contemporary and slice-of-life books may be the least genre that people want to read, especially those who want thrill and adventure. But this genre is my go-to genre all the time. If life gets hard in the present, ironically, I search for books that are relatable and face reality. It's like getting a second slap of reality but that's my preference. If I like an author's books then there's a high possibility I search for his/her books like Mitch Albom, Maeve Binchy, Rosamunde Pilcher, and even Debbie Macomber. They've been writers for decades now and I seldom search for new authors. 

Choosing Other Genres 

I am not really strict in choosing my genre as long as I like the vibes of the book and its plot. I don't care if it's action or mystery as long as it's not horror, especially gore. 

If there were genres that I least pick, regardless of the books, it would be science fiction and horror. If it's paranormal, I'm fine with the genre as long as it's not gore. 

When it comes to length, I always prefer short novels and stand-alone and I seldom read series, especially fantasy when every book needs to be read because it's connected. I'm fine with a series that can be stand-alone. The last time I read a fantasy series was about some royalties fighting for an oppressive empire. It really depends on how the flow of the story turns out. And like other readers, I also have my fair share of dropping tons of books for different reasons. 

My lair of genres is romance (not full-blown but also with subgenres like mystery, thriller, paranormal, action, fantasy, and such). When I'm through with romance, I go back to contemporary or slice-of-life or explore heavy genres like crime, thriller, fantasy, mystery, and adventure. 

I also read non-fiction books that cater to my interests \- personal growth, self-development, psychology, relationships, MBTI, and other stuff that can be used in our lives. When reading nonfiction, the pacing is slower than in fiction since I have to digest what I read and reflect on it. 

In some instances, I read short recommendations from fellow bookworms, like classic books (the short ones), poetry, and literature from other countries. I just scroll and search through Pinterest and find readings that suit my taste.

# Particular in Writing Style, Atmosphere, Characters & Plot 

The elements I mentioned in this section were the reasons I put down a book or discarded it and let it stay on the back burner. Harsh, right? But you have the choice to stick to a book until the end or end the reading halfway. You are entitled because you are a reader with the freedom to choose whatever you read. 

I've always been a reader of atmospheric and emotional books and if you're familiar with Rosamunde Pilcher or L. Montgomery, then you'll probably know the vibes of atmospheric books. I've come across a pin that starting a narration of weather is not advisable but if you're Rosamunde Pilcher or Montgomery, starting the story with the weather and the settings aren't an off but an introduction to the world the characters are living in. 

I've always liked books with strong fundamentals when it comes to setting, vacuuming me into the world of the characters and atmospheric books always influenced my style of writing. 

On the other hand, regardless of the plot, I always go for the characters. If I don't like the protagonist, I will likely put down the book, especially when characters aren't that smart and just make dumb decisions that will ultimately destroy their lives. No, I will definitely put those kind of characters. 

When it comes to the plot, I check the trope first based on the teaser or blurb of the book then the first chapter. I always check if I can go through all of the chapters with their writing style. If not, I'm gonna put the book down. No other reasons. Writing style matters to me a lot. 

I'm more of a character type of reader than the plot so having just vibes books doesn't matter to me since I've venturing Japanese literature known for having slice-of-life books, focusing more on philosophical themes and life concepts. 

I read any form of book, soft copies, and hard copies. Lately, I've been into ebooks since it's convenient and you could just read books anywhere. 

The choice of reading materials depends on the individual. If they're into nonfiction, they seek knowledge and wisdom constantly on aspects of life and reality. If they're into fiction, they want to use their creativity and imagination and want to experience the worlds inside a novel. Regardless of your choice of books, books impart knowledge, and wisdom and evoke feelings, emotions, judgment, and imagination. It takes you to many places and experiences. 

You don't have to force yourself to books you don't feel like finishing. You have the right to put down a book. It isn't a crime. Understand that every one of us has our own preferences when it comes to our choices and interests.
