title: The Coffee Shop
subtitle: Owl-like glasses. A baseball cap. And a guitar case. People came into the Coffee Shop because they were stuck outside due to heavy rain despite summertime and Jae was one of them. He kindly asked to share a table with me and I agreed, still holding my book and a bit reluctant when he asked some questions about what I was reading. A bit shy from the sudden interaction, Jae did not falter from it. Instead, he smiled a lot, and when he smiled, his eyes and face brightened like sunshine. The serene ambiance of the Coffee Shop, the rustic and wooden interior, and the aroma of coffee and pastries are the reasons why I stayed for hours there. And him.

Owl-like glasses. A baseball cap. And a guitar case. People came into the Coffee Shop because they were stuck outside due to heavy rain despite summertime and Jae was one of them. He kindly asked to share a table with me and I agreed, still holding my book and a bit reluctant when he asked some questions about what I was reading. A bit shy from the sudden interaction, Jae did not falter from it. Instead, he smiled a lot, and when he smiled, his eyes and face brightened like sunshine. The serene ambiance of the Coffee Shop, the rustic and wooden interior, and the aroma of coffee and pastries are the reasons why I stayed for hours there. And him.

Just like me, Jae is a patron of the Coffee Shop but he usually stays there during the night while I stay during the day. One meeting turned into a random meeting. We talked almost about everything. Even the mysteries of death. He liked his coffee black and avocado sandwiches. While I’m writing essays, he’s writing lyrics. While I’m reading non-fiction books, he reads his speculative fiction books. After all those years of being alone, the warmth I felt with things I adored and enjoyed was entirely different when I was with Jae.

He dragged me to his gigs that I was willingly going to despite the loud crowd, and instead of spending his time with his bandmates, Jae would spend it with me in a convenience store, eating ramen noodles with me. Jae was like a spring breeze to me, an occurrence after the barren winter that stayed for too long. It’s hard for me to open up with someone but with Jae, I found my solace.

Until, one day. I haven’t seen him. My favorite month was the autumn season. And I was left alone in the Coffee Shop. There was a pang in my chest when I remembered the memories I had with Jae. Did I become dependent on him? Did I make him uncomfortable? Did I become a burden to him? Lots of questions bombarded my mind. Should I be happy because I went back to my life before him? Did I scare him away? Spending my time in solitude.

Winter came. I saw him again. In the Coffee Shop. Instead of approaching him, I settled on my usual spot, ordered my caramel latte, and opened my book; silently whispering to myself that Jae would notice me. But he didn’t. He caught my eyes but not even an ounce of recognition, and it hit me when a girl walked towards him. I saw his smile I had yearned to look at for months. He knew almost everything about me but I realized, I only knew a little about him. A lady in her late twenties talked to him and I wondered who she was in his life that he hugged her deliberately. He stormed out of the coffee shop with the guitar case on his back.

That lady went towards me and caught me staring at the running Jae outside of the Coffee Shop.

“You’re probably the girl he met during the summer,” she said softly and mysteriously smiled.

“Uhmm? Yes.” My eyebrows furrowed in confusion. How did she know it?

“I already reminded him. That he’s not supposed to meet someone new at the start of the season.”

“Is there something wrong with it?” I tried to hold back my irritation.

“After the season ended, he initially forgets the girl.” I didn’t like the glint in her eyes. “Regardless of gender, he forgets people he met every season.”

I recalled the days we spent with each other during the summertime. When the autumn started, he vanished like a soda pop.

“That’s his punishment.” And before I could even blink, the lady disappeared. The people were staring at me with confusion in their eyes. I did not know what was going on but I knew that I was dealing with something beyond my understanding.

It was my last time staying in the Coffee Shop. And I didn’t see Jae again. He was like an angel to me, a breath of fresh air, my stepping stone in the outside world, away from my comfort zone. I found a group of people who have the same interests as me. I became a better version of myself.

Jae came into my life like a flowing wind.
