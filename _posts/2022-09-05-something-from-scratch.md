# **Something From Scratch**

Stories on textbooks were my first step into the world of fiction and commonly about folklore, legends, fables, and short stories. I always knew I had a hyperactive imagination and it frequently stayed in my head during my childhood. Kids were playing around in the classroom while me stared out the window. Just simply staring at the scenery of the countryside. I was first exposed to the beauty of reading. Being fascinated by stories filled with experiences through the eyes of the narrator. 

I still remember when I carried those old books that had brownish pages from my neighbors. Books that were supposed to perish in a garbage can but I rescued it, and tucked it in my home. As I flipped the pages, my mind wondered at how wide the world was. Far from the world, I’m living in as a small kid. That it was possible to be stirred by emotions while reading. Experience of something I didn’t experience. See other places through the stories. And compared that culture and the society I grew up with the books I read. I remembered how it felt to lose someone through a book and how it gave inspiration. 

Reading fiction ignited a fire in me and that was when I opened the door of the writing world. I still remember how happy I was when I finished writing my stories in my notebook, handwritten single-handedly. My friends were my first readers, and I felt satisfied when I received their reactions. I have no manual, only my reading experience. I am barely picking up my writing voice and writing style. Over the years, I could tell I had improved and demolished the trends those days and searched my own niché. 

Being a writer means creating something from scratch. You have to grasp for the right words, to establish a world, born characters, and play god. Through writing, my thoughts were smooth all through out, decluttered and organized it naturally. At first, it was hobby. It was fun to create scenarious and write it on pages, grinning how the scenes turns out. Little did I know writing offers more than just a hobby. 

It’s therapeutic in a way, it makes me calm after I released it through words that’s dancing and circling inside my head. Words engraved on papers like how the river flows through the vast ocean. 

It’s an escape and a comforter when the the noises of the world were too much and when reality was cruel. Socializing was never a thing for me. Everybody blocked out when I starts writing, deep in my imagination and my mind. I only hear the pitter-patter of the rain on rooftops and fading noises around me. 

Writing, for me, is a safe haven. It’s where I pour out my thoughts and make sense of it. It’s where I am free to be myself and live. It’s where I breathe and fly high above the clouds and dive deeply into the ocean. Writing felt like standing on the edge of a cliff while admiring the cerulean skies and ocean waves. But writing could also be an untamed torrential storm, strong winds, and heavy rains. It’s a rollercoaster ride that I bravely want to take. 

Being a writer is not always smooth sailing. You have to deal with dull days and a hollow heart along the way. You have to rest for a while when you can’t grasp words until you’re too tired to bleed out your thoughts. There were times I was critical of myself as a writer, questioning if this is the right path I was taking. That writing was not meant for me, and I was scared to leave. I did. A couple of times. But at the end of the day, I always go back and pick up my notebook and pen, then scribble my thoughts again. 

Letting others read your writings means letting them know your vulnerable states and your deepest thoughts and rawest emotions. Judgments and criticisms from other people come with exposing your writings, which makes me want to hide in my safe shell again. But my will to write is stronger than my doubts so I keep on pushing through the mud. 

As a writer, I retraced my goals and purposes. I keep on thinking where should I start and when I faced on a dead-end, I retraced the steps and try not to be scared dealing with detours and stop-overs. 

It’s not all about stringing words but more of stirring the reader’s emotions and your stories as their solace. 

Journeying through life being a writer is a humble purpose of reaching out to people, living and freeing myself from the shackles. It’s being brave to face whatever comes my ways and I humbly share it with you.
