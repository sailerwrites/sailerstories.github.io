# Power of Pen

Undeniably, the pen holds the versions of truth in the eyes of the writers and of the artists who are witnesses of the world we are living in. The power of the pen accounts for the tales and memories long gone yet cherished and will be remembered. I see a series of episodes and scenes unfolding in front of my eyes. A part of it spills on papers and a door to another universe. A universe that contains the threads of the long-gone hinterlands in the recesses of my mind.

Where should I go next? In searching in every nook and cranny, I realize that we can paint a bigger picture from smaller details and vice versa. The world is vast. Road signs and town signage might paint a bigger idea for you, the story behind it and how it witnesses the everyday mundane. It’s a wonder to find that the smallest sensible ones are significant too. Merely a puzzle piece to an unfinished puzzle set.

The power of the pen can cast a spell to a reader and a privilege to writers to share their world and know the workings of their mind. The workings of our mind can be either systematically concrete or abstract, coming from a different angle. How it’s sometimes fascinating how distinct the narrative is from another narrative and of the same origin.

How strange it is to excavate symbols and metaphors from the roads we pass by and explore both its beauty and ugliness. I see to it that a place can be a representation of something our mind perceives. It’s in the working of our imagination, and a reality we perceive through different lenses lies the power of our pen.
