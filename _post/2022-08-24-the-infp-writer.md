#   The INFP Writer

With a deep emotional sense of the world, lover of language, and vivid imagination, INFPs are more likely to be a writer or an artist. INFP is one of the 16 personalities of Myers-Briggs, commonly described as the ‘cinnamon roll’, ‘delicate fighter’, and ‘whimsical fairies’ but there’s more to the INFP personality than meets the eye. We could be the emo who devoured horror and mystery-thriller films, while jamming with dark-themed music or we could be the laidback nerd who loves to read fantasy and adventure books, daydreaming in a corner, and hoards mementos. Most INFPs are writers and there are known writers typed as an INFP that marked a legacy in the literature world with their remarkable stories that welcome you to faraway kingdoms, idyllic communities, and gothic-feel sceneries. 

# INFP Functions as a Writer 

The Dominant function of INFP is Fi. Introverted feeling is the moral compass of the INFP and cares about personal’s values, beliefs and interests. With a deep interest in observing and absorbing details about the personal lives of others, I often find myself reflecting on my own set of values, emotions, and beliefs, balancing on what is right and wrong but somehow give the benefit of the doubt. This way, we explore the depths of our emotions and soul and we are not afraid of the things we will discover. For example, Edgar Allan Poe produced masterpieces showcasing the complexities of one’s soul and turmoil of emotions. It takes us to a feeling when you are at the edge of the cliff, staring at the wide expanse of the gray ocean and a storm is brewing— a sublime sight. Instead of going mainstream, we create something out of the ordinary that channels our rich inner world. 

The Auxiliary Function of INFP is Ne, the Extroverted Intuition. It is the ability to connect possibilities, future ideas and abstract ideas. We get inspiration from the world around us. Being a keen observant, the things we have witnessed are often digested in our minds. We looked around and gave meanings to the places and things our eyes have seen. We might write something about the product warnings, the broken traffic signs, the open manholes and stare at it for too long. That way, our minds produce original ideas by connecting things in the outer world. This function also allows us INFPs to see all sides and all angles of an individual or a situation in which we gain fresh perspectives. 

The Tertiary Function is Si, Introverted Sensing in which we re-examine our past experiences, feelings of nostalgia and mementos. This is when we reflect on our memories and our past journals and accounts are great references for our writing projects. We remembered the tiny details of our past; like the way we dance under the rain, the aroma of the delicacies during fiestas, and the nostalgic moments we have with our loved ones. This way, as an INFP writer, this ability carries the sensory details and mood we put on paper. The accounts of our past can be the source of our inspiration. 

The Inferior Function is Te, Extroverted Thinking, the ability of manifesting our dreams into reality. Since, this is the inferior function of INFP, we struggle on organizing our plans. A healthy Te function means create effective plans into working out our goals. The productivity function. 

# Attentive to Mood and Atmosphere 

This is the reason why INFPs thrive well in the Fantasy genre because we are attentive to details. World-building is quite exciting and challenging for us especially when we pick out whimsical names, plan geographical landscapes, cities and kingdoms and even seas where pirates are traveling. The world inside the INFP’s mind is rich and through writing, this world will take you to something extraordinary. As much as I enjoyed reading atmospheric books, I enjoyed writing atmospheric and vivid writings regardless of the genre I’ve written. The ideas in my inner world or the vision I’ve pictured out have been reflected on my writings, even the smallest details. The Ne Function is able to expand an idea or a certain context and weave it through concrete and sensory details. These kinds of stories make the readers feel like she’s or he’s in that quaint town, cold wasteland, eerie tower, and desolate lake. 

Human Interests and Personal Connection  
Since INFPs are not afraid to delve in deeper into complex emotions and feelings, and intricacies of human relationships. These complexities are concealed in poetry. INFPs are wordsmiths in their own way, they can describe these intangible things in abstract and archaic manner. The desires, motivations, and back stories of the characters are tiny bits of the writer itself. This way, we are delving into the workings of our character’s mind and attitude; how they deal with the situation and the society. When writing short stories, I often find myself focusing on the characters rather than the plot. The character is the main ingredient of a story or a novel, where the plot works based on their choices but that still depends on the author. As an INFP, we are curious about the lives of others, and that way the tiny bits we earn from them are planted in our working projects. 

# Working on Writing Projects 

We have too many ideas, we never run out of ideas except when we are mentally stressed and distressed. Too often we don’t know how to start so there are times we worked on multiple projects resulting in not finishing or discontinuing some writing projects. I have several drafts in my folder, still unfinished and untouched for weeks, months, and even years. But if we have the determination to finish it, we can make it while defying procrastination. You just have to retrace your steps and ask yourself of your purpose as a writer. 

As an INFP, and a scattered brain, jotting down details on my notebooks are not organized and sometimes I drew some doodles, boxes, circles to highlight the important details. The rest are in venn diagrams and family trees. Sometimes, I squeeze in my ideas in just one page with barely any space left. And weirdly, I could spot the details I needed even though everything was messy. 

I don’t have a specific schedule in writing and only depends on my energy outburst. I might not write regularly but I can work on a writing project and finish it in a short period of time. Every writing project, I based it on whether I am into writing it or not and when I couldn’t push myself to finish a certain writing project, I would start another project. An INFP writer’s mind is not linear, which means they go in a circular manner. Sometimes, ideas rush in our minds and we have to write it down even though the events in the story happened in the middle. This writing habit has been reflected in my stories where I have several transitions between the past and the present events. There are moments too when I struggled to grasp the appropriate words for the visuals I have in my head that would leave me frustrated. The Expectation vs. Reality scenario. 

At some point, we experiment on some ideas and ask ourselves ‘What could be possibly done?’ ‘What if I retell it in another way?’. Rush of ideas are like currents in the ocean, we are open to possibilities. There are also moments when I have to recall an idea and couldn’t remember it since a multitude of ideas also drown me. Ideas could be random. Sometimes, I thought of a context inside a jeepney, while washing the dishes and washing the clothes. Oddly, to generate other ideas, I distract myself with other activities than forcing myself to think about it. 

This ball of loneliness, depths, and authenticity inside of us; we express it through writing. Not afraid of how dark, disturbing, and chaotic it is in our minds.
